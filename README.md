Analysing Twitter sentiment using machine learning

üîç Analysing Twitter sentiment using machine learning
Have you ever wondered how to analyse and understand the emotions of millions of users on Twitter? This project takes you on an exciting journey towards exploring the world of emotions by analysing Twitter tweets using modern machine learning techniques.
üöÄ Project milestones:
Data preparation: We carefully merged training and evaluation data, cleaning and standardising the transcripts to prepare them for rigorous analysis.
Data visualisation: We created stunning word clouds highlighting the most common words in positive and negative tweets, as well as a comprehensive sentiment distribution analysis.
Model training: We used a multi-class Naive Bayes model, one of the best methods in text classification, to accurately and efficiently classify the sentiment of the tweets.
Evaluate the model: We evaluated the performance of the model using the noise matrix and classification reports to provide insight into the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.
üõ†Ô∏è Techniques and tools used:
Pandas for data analysis and management.
seaborn for attractive data visualisation.
scikit-learn to build and train the model.
wordcloud to create visual word clouds.
This project is not just a machine learning application, but a window into how technology can be used to understand sentiment and public opinion in real time. Join this project and explore how machine learning can redefine how we interact with textual data on social media!
